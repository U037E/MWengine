2d Game Engine in progress

I am trying to develop a 2d game engine with the help of various tutorials available.
The first goal is to get the engine running.
The first features implemented will be an interactive Window with basic graphics and the typical mouse-actions available in fixed-screen-based 2d adventure games (no character present, first person view)
The ultimate goal is to program a short 2d-adventure with multiple screens and interactions that will take the user on a short, atmospheric adventure
